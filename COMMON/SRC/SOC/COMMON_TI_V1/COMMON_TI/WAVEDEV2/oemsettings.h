Abstract:       Platform dependent code for the mixing audio driver.

// Set USE_MIX_SATURATE to 1 if you want the mixing code to guard against saturation
// This costs a couple of instructions in the inner loop

// The code will use the follwing values as saturation points

// The following define the maximum attenuations for the SW volume controls in devctxt.cpp
// e.g. 100 => range is from 0dB to -100dB

#define DEVICE_ATTEN_MAX        35
#define CLASS_ATTEN_MAX         35

// If set to 1, all gain will be mono (left volume applied to both channels)
#define MONO_GAIN 0

// If set to 1, midi code will be included in the driver (~4k)
#define ENABLE_MIDI 1

// If set to 1, the driver won't do internal mixing and will rely on the OS mixer
#define USE_OS_MIXER 1
